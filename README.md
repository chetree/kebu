# kebu (Kebun Ibu)

Welcome to the ** kebu (Kebun Ibu)** repository. This repository collects resources for developing smart farming solutions in Kebun Ibu, an innovative initiative aimed at integrating advanced technology with traditional farming practices. Here, you'll find a collection of software, firmware, documents, and 3D designs that our team uses to create sustainable, efficient, and productive farming systems.

Kebun Ibu focuses on transforming agriculture through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data analytics, and automated systems. Our goal is to optimize resource usage, enhance crop yields, and promote environmentally friendly farming methods. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we aim to empower farmers with tools and insights that can lead to better decision-making and improved farm management.

## Use Cases and Developments
### Automated Irrigation System

We developed an automated irrigation system that uses soil moisture sensors to determine the optimal watering schedule, reducing water usage and ensuring plants get the right amount of water.

### Environmental Monitoring

Our sensors monitor temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors in real-time. This data helps farmers make informed decisions about planting and harvesting.

### Pest Control System

We use data-driven algorithms to predict pest outbreaks and deploy targeted interventions, minimizing the use of chemical pesticides.

### Growth Tracking

Our software tracks the growth and health of crops using image recognition and machine learning algorithms, providing insights into crop development and potential issues.

### Resource Optimization

We implement resource optimization techniques to ensure efficient use of water, fertilizers, and energy, promoting sustainable farming practices.

## TODO
Integrate additional sensors for more detailed environmental monitoring.

Develop machine learning models for predictive analytics.

Expand the automated irrigation system to support multi-crop scenarios.

Create user-friendly dashboards for real-time data visualization.

Implement energy-efficient power management for all IoT devices.
